		<h1>Hi, I'm Jordan. I like programming.</h1>
		<p>As a child, I was obsessed with the idea of creating my very own video game, and even cobbled some together in PowerPoint out of desperation. This lead me to find Command Prompt when I was 9 years old, and—though I would never wish <ExternalA href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file">batch script</ExternalA> on anyone—it sparked a love for programming that has stuck with me throughout my life. I eventually joined a programming course at my <ExternalA href="https://www.communidee.ca/">homeschooling centre</ExternalA>; this was my first experience meeting others who liked programming, and it was amazing.</p>
		<p>I've been programming ever since, and now attend the <ExternalA href="https://johnabbott.qc.ca/career-programs/computer-science-technology/">Computer Science Technology program at John Abbott College</ExternalA>. Though the dream of making my own games lives on, I've come to adore the diverse challenges programming offers and the people I've gotten to share them with. I love participating in programming competitions, and I tutor people in the hopes of being surpassed by them some day.</p>
		<p>Oh, and I like watching anime, occasionally writing poems I daren't share here, and going on impractically long walks through monotonous suburban hellscapes.</p>
